Setting up jlenv on a production server is exactly the same as in development. 
Some considerations for a hypothetical deployment strategy:

* It is suggested that there is a single user for deployment, e.g. "deploy" user
* `JLENV_ROOT` is at the default location: `/home/deploy/.jlenv`
* Julia versions are either installed or symlinked to `~/.jlenv/versions`
* jlenv version 1.0 or greater is recommended.

## Ensure consistent PATH for processes

Interactive, non-interactive shells, cron jobs, and similar processes for the 
"app" user all must ensure that jlenv is present in the `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH=~/.jlenv/shims:~/.jlenv/bin:"$PATH"
```
