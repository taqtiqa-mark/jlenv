At a high level, jlenv intercepts Julia commands using shim
executables injected into your `PATH`, determines which Julia version
has been specified by your application, and passes your commands along
to the correct Julia installation.

## Understanding PATH

When you run a command like `julia`, your operating system
searches through a list of directories to find an executable file with
that name. This list of directories lives in an environment variable
called `PATH`, with each directory in the list separated by a colon:

    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

Directories in `PATH` are searched from left to right, so a matching
executable in a directory at the beginning of the list takes
precedence over another one at the end. In this example, the
`/usr/local/bin` directory will be searched first, then `/usr/bin`,
then `/bin`.

## Understanding Shims

jlenv works by inserting a directory of _shims_ at the front of your
`PATH`:

    ~/.jlenv/shims:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

Through a process called _rehashing_, jlenv maintains shims in that
directory to match every Julia command across every installed version
of Julia.

Shims are lightweight executables that simply pass your command along
to jlenv. So with jlenv installed, when you run, say, `julia`, your
operating system will do the following:

* Search your `PATH` for an executable file named `julia`
* Find the jlenv shim named `julia` at the beginning of your `PATH`
* Run the shim named `julia`, which in turn passes the command along to
  jlenv

## Choosing the Julia Version

When you execute a shim, jlenv determines which Julia version to use by
reading it from the following sources, in this order:

1. The `JLENV_VERSION` environment variable, if specified. You can use
   the [`jlenv shell`](#jlenv-shell) command to set this environment
   variable in your current shell session.

2. The first `.julia-version` file found by searching the directory of the
   script you are executing and each of its parent directories until reaching
   the root of your filesystem.

3. The first `.julia-version` file found by searching the current working
   directory and each of its parent directories until reaching the root of your
   filesystem. You can modify the `.julia-version` file in the current working
   directory with the [`jlenv local`](#jlenv-local) command.

4. The global `~/.jlenv/version` file. You can modify this file using
   the [`jlenv global`](#jlenv-global) command. If the global version
   file is not present, jlenv assumes you want to use the "system"
   Juliaâ€”i.e. whatever version would be run if jlenv weren't in your
   path.

## Locating the Julia Installation

Once jlenv has determined which version of Julia your application has
specified, it passes the command along to the corresponding Julia
installation.

Each Julia version is installed into its own directory under
`~/.jlenv/versions`. For example, you might have these versions
installed:

* `~/.jlenv/versions/v0.6.0/`
* `~/.jlenv/versions/v0.6.0-rc3/`
* `~/.jlenv/versions/v0.5.0/`

Version names to jlenv are simply the names of the directories in
`~/.jlenv/versions`.
