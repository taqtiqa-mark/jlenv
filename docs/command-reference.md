Like `git`, the `jlenv` command delegates to subcommands based on its
first argument. The most common subcommands are:

## jlenv local

Sets a local application-specific Julia version by writing the version
name to a `.julia-version` file in the current directory. This version
overrides the global version, and can be overridden itself by setting
the `JLENV_VERSION` environment variable or with the `jlenv shell`
command.

    $ jlenv local v0.6.0

When run without a version number, `jlenv local` reports the currently
configured local version. You can also unset the local version:

    $ jlenv local --unset

## jlenv global

Sets the global version of Julia to be used in all shells by writing
the version name to the `~/.jlenv/version` file. This version can be
overridden by an application-specific `.julia-version` file, or by
setting the `JLENV_VERSION` environment variable.

    $ jlenv global v0.6.0

The special version name `system` tells jlenv to use the system Julia
(detected by searching your `$PATH`).

When run without a version number, `jlenv global` reports the
currently configured global version.

## jlenv shell

Sets a shell-specific Julia version by setting the `JLENV_VERSION`
environment variable in your shell. This version overrides
application-specific versions and the global version.

    $ jlenv shell v0.6.0

When run without a version number, `jlenv shell` reports the current
value of `JLENV_VERSION`. You can also unset the shell version:

    $ jlenv shell --unset

## jlenv versions

Lists all Julia versions known to jlenv, and shows an asterisk next to
the currently active version.

    $ jlenv versions
      v0.6.0
    * v0.6.0-rc1 (set by /Users/sam/.jlenv/version)

## jlenv version

Displays the currently active Julia version, along with information on
how it was set.

    $ jlenv version
    v0.6.0 (set by /Users/sam/.jlenv/version)

## jlenv rehash

Installs shims for all Julia executables known to jlenv (i.e.,
`~/.jlenv/versions/*/bin/*`). Run this command after you install a new
version of Julia, or install a gem that provides commands.

    $ jlenv rehash

## jlenv which

Displays the full path to the executable that jlenv will invoke when
you run the given command.

    $ jlenv which julia
    /Users/sam/.jlenv/versions/v0.6.0/bin/julia

## jlenv whence

Lists all Julia versions with the given command installed.

    $ jlenv whence julia
    v0.6.0
